# Mira2mqtt
Monitor Ovum heatpumps with Mira firmware via VNC.

> ⚠️ **PLEASE NOTE**
> In newer firmware versions (>= 1.1.3), the VNC port is no longer open, so you will not have local access to the user interface.
> In this case, you should use the official Modbus interface provided by Mira in these newer firmware versions.

In older firmware revsions, Ovum did not provide an official API to connect to their heat pumps running the Mira firmware.
This software attempts to circumvent this by connecting to the VNC port provided by Mira and retrieving data via OCR (optical character recognition).
The retrieved data is then sent to a MQTT broker, where it can be further processed, e.g., by a home automation solution such as OpenHAB, Home Assistant, and others.

The standard configuration is set to only retrieve. 

In theory, controlling the heatpump is possible as well, as long as the setting you want to change is accessible via the Mira UI.  
The configuration allows you to specify how certain areas of the user interface should be accessed and which coordinates should be clicked on.
In this case, however, you are on your own. I will not provide any assistance in this regard.

## Installation
### Install required packages (Debian or Ubuntu)
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip tesseract-ocr ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 git
```

### Install OCR language package
You must install a special language pack for the language in which your Mira user interface is currently configured (not required for English).
Example for German:
```
apt install tesseract-ocr-deu
```

### Clone the Github repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Schneydr/Mira2mqtt.git
```

### Create and prepare python environment
```
cd Mira2mqtt
mkdir -p .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

### Install python packages
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip 
python3 -m pip install opencv-python
python3 -m pip install vncdotool
python3 -m pip install pytesseract
python3 -m pip install paho-mqtt
```

### Configure 
You need to set at least the hostname or ip address of your heat pump within your local network. Furthermore, you should configure the language and locale matching the setting of your Mira UI.

If your UI language is not German you should also change the mandatory text configurations.

In case you want to use MQTT you have to activate MQTT usage and configure broker ip address, port, user and password.
```
nano mira2mqtt.py
```

### Run the programm
```
./mira.sh
```
